# Opensouurce cities of the future

## Brief description
Creating a solid methodology on main points that needs to be answered while developing a open-source, private city.

## Project full description
Future will be without governments and borders -> that's clear at least for me.
For this future to arrive as soon as possible, we need to create open cross-interacting methodology that will allow to connect cities together.
You can also call this an "open city interconnection protocol" or OC-IP.
When the methodology will be in ALPHA or BETA mode, we can try to test it out in some real cities.

Of course, in the beginning there would be small villages, that would become cities in the future.

Some examples of current villages and maybe-future-cities are:
* Liberstad.com (Norway)
* Dobrograd (Russia)

## Parts of methodology
This methodology should describe different parts of life in the city.
* Blockchain-based proposal and voting system (including voting on wherever taxes will go)
* Fully transparent tax system (from getting the tax to spending the tax)
* Human Resource accounting system
* Physical resources and materials accounting system (online & offline)
* Automated system for collecting feedback
* Automated transport system based on autonomous electric vehicles
* Automated climate and ecological control system

Each of the bulletpoints from this list might be expanded as separate opensource methodology and underlying source code project.
