# Fight Fake Science project

## Brief description
Web-based tool that allows you to fight fake science in effective manner (by betting & voting).

In another terms, we help populating the SCIENTIFIC approach while they also earn money.

Important: this is not a betting project idea, but it's a SCIENTIFIC AMPLIFICATION project.

### Preface and problem description
Have you ever encountered a friends, that tells you some conspirological theories? 
* like, "dangerousness" of some new kind of tech (can be any kind)
* or a friend who's trying to prove that world is controlled by one government (one one reptiloid?)
* or maybe you had an argue-bet with your friend but never got a chance for safe betting?

If the answer is yes, you'd probably struggle to bring him to common grounds: science & discussion.
People tend to believe in crazy things. The more crazy thing is, the more people might believe it.
Information technologies gives us power to spread information, no matter how serious, true or fake it is.

So we need to deal with this problem. I found one way to do it.

### Project full description
Web-based tool where two or more sides meet in the common grounds of real science and proofchecked information.
System involves the "competing" sides, jundges-voters and users-donators.

Important here is that only one side is required to initiate the "deal" or "define a problem".
To do it, he/she needs to freeze his/her money in an ESCROW.
Another side will see this frozen money when checking out the web page of the "problem" or "deal".

This way we can see if:
* both sides of the problem TAKE IT SERIOUSLY (hense the money)
* even more important they TAKE IT SCIENTIFICALLY (done good research on topic or being a specialist in the field)
* both sides will also need to invest time amongst money to register, verify and send money to platform (that's measure for additional "seriocity") 

As they vote with their own MONEY and REPUTATION.

### Project pipeline with examples
= DRAFT STATE =
1) One or two sides of the conflict rise their topic. For example, "alcohol protects you from viruses".
2) Each side of the conflict takes one of the position: "pro-position" (says that topic is TRUE) and "opposing force position" (says that topic is FALSE)
3) Criterias are setted-up, for example: "10 fact-checked science articles from popular science source"
4) Criterias are described: here you describe what means "fact-checked", describe sources lists of "popular science sources"
5) Project time-frame is set: 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 5 years etc. Can be any date in the future. Also judge time is set (less than the project's time-frame)
6) Judges are invited (can be one ESCROW jundge or multiple ones; but ideally an odd number of judges)
7) Prize pool rules is set:
* what currencies to use for this problem (can be ideally a cryptocurrency, but normal currencies might also be accepted)
* condition if one side wins (for example, gets 90% of the prize minus 5% judge comissions and 5% platform comissions)
* condition if both sides are somewhat correct (for example, each side got their full money back)
"Problematic" conditions can either be setted by creators OR by platform:
* condition on judges not found (ex., money back)
* condition on technical problems (full money back)
* condition on problem timeout (judges didn't decided but the end date reached): (ex.: money back minus 5% to platform)
8) The money from ONE or BOTH sides is frozen in platform ESCROW
After at least one side frozes it's money in ESCROW, we're entering hte PRE-ACTIVE STATE.
= PRE-ACTIVE STATE =
If money is received from one ESCROW side, the problem is published online and available for review, but the judges are not arranged.
At the moment the money was received by BOTH sides and frozen in ESCROW smart contract, we're entering ACTIVE STATE.
= ACTIVE STATE =
If money gathered in ESCROW from both sides, we know that both of the deal's sides take problem seriously.
Process of arranging the judges starts and it can take some time, depending on the number of judges, but the problem is anyway published online.
= JUDGING STATE =
When judges accept their invitation to the project, they can specify approx time they need.
It's automatically setted-up to the project's maxium (for example, creator set project time as 1 month and judge time as 1 week), but judges can set time to less amount (say, 4 or 3 days).

FINALE: After the 

### Re-judging
I don't see any real reasons to implement additional options to re-judge rather than describing a separate deal:
* User that is not "happy" with the judge deceision, sets a new deal with more money then he invested for the first time
* If he wins this time, in result his previous money are "returned" with some xtra
* In the most cases probably user will actually fail again as other judge will both take into consideration previous judge comments as well as his own research

### PR page with ratings for social sharing
There should be two kinds of pages for everybody to check out:
* the project page: what the voting is about and results of the voting, if finished, as well as user's and judge's comments
* the user's page: description of user-created "deals", outcomes, etc.

This pages are important as with them we can show people how scientific approach works.
Even better, we can help people earn money while populating the SCIENTIFIC approach.

### Everyone is involved!
Other users, that are not part of the deal and not the judges, can make a DONATION for a WINNING CONDITION.
They CANNOT vote for any side, rather they are DONATING towards the SCIENTIFIC CONDITION that will win.
Remember - this is not a betting website idea, rather than SCIENTIFIC IMPLIFICATOR idea.
When donating, they can choose what to do with their money in case the deal is unsolved/cancelled/mediated 50/50%.
For example, they can spread money 50/50 to winners or ask the platform to send their money back.

When user donates towards the winning outcome, he is receiving some reputation and the deal-related "donator" badge/achievement.

### Comission schemes
Platform should get larger comission (example: 2x...10x to normal comission) for fiat currencies because they involves gateways and chargebacks.

### Platform roles
a) users-problem creators that adds the "deals" or "problems"
b) judges that decide on the problems (can be one or multiple, but ideally odd number)
c) normal "external" users that are not the part of the deal (they can donate to the future winner of the problem)
d) administrators and tech stuff that handles problems with the system

### ONE DEAL = ONE ROLE
* All users are able to fullfill all roles (except admin roles obviously), but inside ONE DEAL each user is assigned ONLY ONE ROLE.

### Reputation and trasparency
* Platform should show reputation for USERS and JUDGES as well as money earned in the process
* All platform code should be opensource, published & ideally verified by trusted users or companies
* All updates to the platform should be done only after user voting on the idea, except for the fixing technical faults
