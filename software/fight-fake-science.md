# Fight Fake Science project

## Brief description
Web-based tool that allows you to fight fake science in effective manner (by betting & voting).

In another terms, the project will help populating the SCIENTIFIC approach while users also can earn money.

Important: this is not a betting project idea, but it's a SCIENTIFIC AMPLIFICATION project.

### Preface and problem description
Have you ever encountered a friends, that tells you some strange stories or conspirological theories? 
* like, "dangerousness" of some new kind of tech (can be any kind)
* or a friend who's trying to prove that world is controlled by one government (or one reptiloid?)
* maybe you had an argue-bet with your friend but never got a chance for safe betting?

If the answer is yes, you'd probably struggle to bring him to common grounds: science & discussion.
People tend to believe in crazy things. Sometimes even the more crazy thing is, the more people believe it.

Information technologies gives us power to spread information, **no matter how serious, true or fake it is**.

So we need to deal with this problem. I maybe found a way to do it... that seems legit.

### Project full description
Web-based tool where two or more sides meet in the common grounds of real science and proofchecked information.
System involves the "competing" sides, jundges-voters and users-donators.

Important here is that only one side is required to initiate the "deal" or "define a problem".
To do it, he/she needs to freeze his/her money in an ESCROW.
Another side will see this frozen money when checking out the web page of the "problem" or "deal".

This way we can see if:
* both sides of the problem TAKE IT SERIOUSLY (hence the money)
* even more important they TAKE IT SCIENTIFICALLY (done good research on topic or being a specialist in the field)
* both sides will also need to invest time amongst money to register, verify and send money to platform (that's measure for additional "seriocity") 

As they vote with their own MONEY and REPUTATION.

### Project pipeline with examples
When one user creates the project or deal, it enters the "draft state" automatically.
= DRAFT STATE =
1) One or two sides of the conflict rise their topic. For example, "drinking alcohol protects you from viruses".
2) Each side of the conflict takes one of the position: "pro-position" (says that topic is TRUE) and "opposing force position" or opposition (says that topic is FALSE), sides can add their position description and links, but the change history will be always preserved & shown
3) Criterias are setted-up, for example: "10 fact-checked science articles from popular science source"
4) Criterias are described: project describer elaborates more on what means "fact-checked", describes sources lists of "popular science sources" etc.
5) Project time-frame is set: 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 5 years etc. Can be any date in the future. 
6) Judges settings are configured: number of judges (do we want one ESCROW jundge or multiple ones; but ideally an odd number of judges), judge time (less than the project's time-frame), judge minimal final comment size in symbols (example 2000)
7) Prize pool rules is set:
* what currencies to use for this problem (can be ideally a cryptocurrency, but normal currencies might also be accepted)
* condition if one side wins (for example, gets 90% of the prize minus 5% judge comissions and 5% platform comissions)
* condition if both sides are somewhat correct (for example, each side got their full money back)
"Problematic" conditions can either be setted by creators OR by platform:
* condition on "judges not found" (ex., money back)
* condition on "technical problems" (full money back)
* condition on "judges timeout" (judges didn't decided but the end date reached): (ex.: money back minus 5% to platform)
8) The money from ONE or BOTH sides is frozen in platform ESCROW
After at least one side frozes it's money in ESCROW, we're entering hte PRE-ACTIVE STATE. The project is now fully public and goes through 4 stages:

### = PRE-ACTIVE STATE =
If money is received from one ESCROW side, the problem is published online and available for review, but the judges are not arranged. At the moment the money was received by BOTH sides and frozen in ESCROW smart contract, we're entering ACTIVE STATE.

### = ACTIVE STATE =
If money gathered in ESCROW from both sides, we know that both of the deal's sides take problem seriously.
Process of arranging the judges starts and it can take some time, depending on the number of judges, but the problem is anyway published online.
While waiting for the judges, each side of the deal can publish and update his opinion (the versions and updates will be all visible!), add links to the sources and articles they found etc. etc., - use scientific approach to show other side why his point of view is correct.

### = JUDGING STATE =
When judges accept their invitation to the project, they can specify time they need.
It's automatically setted-up to the project's maxium (for example, creator set project time as 1 month and judge time as 1 week), but judges can set time to less amount (say, 4 or 3 days).
Probably it would be good idea to prohibid the judges to vote on the same day.
After judges are arranged, they receive information from the both sides: project/deal description, both opinions, version changes, description changes, user reputations, comments and comments changes, etc.

### = FINALE =
Judge(s) have decided on the topic and writes a follow-up comment on his decision (not less than minimal number of symbols setted-up by project creator), giving sides as well as external users the general overview of the problem, related links, and everything he can think of. For our example, let's say that judge decided that "drinking alcohol cannot protect you from viruses". So in the FINALE one of the following happends:
* either one side receives money if it wins (minus judge & platform fees) -> in our example case opposition wins and receives the 90% of the deal budget
* or both sides receive money back if the problem is unclear or everybody's right in their terms or there's been some technical issues

### Transparency of prize fund
Prize fund can be fully shown to judges & users or semi-hidden or fully hidden. This topic needs to be researched more if we need any settings for that or not.

### Re-judging
I don't see any real reasons to implement additional options to re-judge rather than describing a separate deal:
* User, that is not "happy" with the judge deceision, sets a new deal with more money then he invested for the first time
* If he wins this time, in "total" result his previous money are "returned" with some extra
* Probably user will actually fail again as other judge will both take into consideration his own new research as well as previous judge comments on the problem

The only thing we might want to implement here is "re-judging" flag that will allow us to attach previous user's deal so that next time the problem will be decided by another judge (or judges list).

### PR page with ratings for social sharing
There should be two kinds of pages for everybody to check out:
* the project public page: what the voting is about and its results (if finished), as well as user's and judge's comments
* the user's reputation page: description of user-created "deals", outcomes, etc.

This pages are important as with them we can show people how scientific approach works.
Even better, we can help people earn money while populating the SCIENTIFIC approach.

### Blockchain-based for transparency
Ideally, the project would have to be a blockchain-based platform for the following reasons:
* easyness of implementation of any transparent crypto into the platform (that's a requirement for ESCROW smart contracts to function)
* deal should have comments that IS POSSIBLE TO EDIT, BUT also near should be button to open the COMMENTS CHANGE HISTORY, so in general, comments STAYS FOREVER but they are "STILL EDITABLE" in some kind -> this way we can find if somebody is chaning his attitude and it will make it for judges to easier understand if user really taking the point that he tells he does or the user is just trying to MANIPULATE other's opinions

### Crypto, score and reputation
I see this platform can use at least 3 types of assets:
1) "Money" or liquid asset. This is what user are voting for. It can be any crypto such as BTC, ETH, BTS, DOGE, XRP, or any currency as USD, CAD, GBP, EUR, RUB, NOK, etc. This is up to the user but "currencies" will have higher comissions that "crypto" (reason is payment gateways comissions)
2) "Local instant score points" semi-liquid asset. It's something in between the actual money and reputation score. Probably should be implemented as crypto, and also transferrable, but slowly (e.g. you might want to withdraw them, but you need to wait a month or so)
3) Reputation. Impossible to withdraw or transfer. Rep changes only according to outcomes of the deals or judges. There should be two types of reputation shown: first, as "instant reputation" or "current rep" which will be number from -100 to +100 showing approximate user's "quality" as judge or normal user. Second, as "permanent reputation" which never goes down, so it's a "sum" of all positive votes without any effect of negative ones. Example for reputation: user was judges 2 times and he was voted as +68 and +95. Then, also he was in two deals, one time one, one time lost. On the winning he was rated +59 and on loss he got -35. As the reputation never goes down, he's "permanent reputation points" are 68+95+59 which is 222 points, while his current reputation is actually 187. Both reputation's are shown. "Permanent reputation points" can be seen as another option for "account age & account total performance level" without looking into the details while "current" reputation shows the user's qualification on the topics that he judged or took part in.

### User profile page
Along with the other things, user profile should also show:
* registration date
* connected social networks (can be WITH or WITHOUT his links depending on the user publicity settings)
* verification state (maybe?) for the phone/IDs
* number of created deals (mouse over to see WINNINGS and LOSSES)
* number of judges (mouse over to see list of the deals & his choices)
* user's comments
* can be also extended so users will have a public blog even without creating a deals

### Everyone is involved!
Other users, that are not part of the deal and not the judges, can make a DONATION for a WINNING CONDITION.
They CANNOT vote for any side, rather they are DONATING towards the SCIENTIFIC CONDITION that will win.
Remember - this is not a betting website idea, rather than SCIENTIFIC IMPLIFICATOR idea.
When donating, they can choose what to do with their money in case the deal is unsolved/cancelled/mediated 50/50%.
For example, they can spread money 50/50 to winners or ask the platform to send their money back.

When user donates towards the winning outcome, he is receiving some reputation and the deal-related "donator" badge/achievement.

### Comission schemes
Platform should get larger comission (example: 2x...10x to normal comission) for fiat currencies because they involves gateways and chargebacks.

### Platform roles
a) users-problem creators that adds the "deals" or "problems"
b) judges that decide on the problems (can be one or multiple, but ideally odd number)
c) normal "external" users that are not the part of the deal (they can donate to the future winner of the problem)
d) administrators and tech stuff that handles problems with the system

### ONE DEAL = ONE ROLE
* All users are able to fullfill all roles (except admin roles obviously), but inside ONE DEAL each user is assigned ONLY ONE ROLE.

### Reputation and trasparency
* Platform should show reputation for USERS and JUDGES as well as money earned in the process
* All platform code should be opensource, published & ideally verified by trusted users or companies
* All updates to the platform should be done only after user voting on the idea, except for the fixing technical faults

## Functions list
* Deal creating interface
* Deals list
* User list
* Comments (for external users) with THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN and ~ (50/50 or unsure point). User might choose to support one, another or all sides of the deal with one comment. User might edit his comment but the comment history will be preserved & shown inside of his comment. User also can comment without choosing any of the sides. Comments can be sub-commented also with same options, and the level of max sub-sommenting can be either infitite or limited to some number.
* Money topup, withdraw & converting options

## Platform development options
* TBD
* Steem-code based maybe? Or not.
