# Fight Fake Science project

## Brief description
Web-based tool that allows you to fight fake science in effective manner (by betting & voting).

Important here is that ONLY ONE SIDE can initiate the "deal" or "define a problem".
To initiate or define a problem, at least one side need to freeze his/her money in an ESCROW.
Another side will see this frozen money when checking out the web page of the "problem" or "deal".

This way we can see if:
* both sides of the problem TAKE IT SERIOUSLY 
* even more important they TAKE IT SCIENTIFICALLY (done good research on topic or being a specialist in the field)

As they vote with their own MONEY and REPUTATION.

Important: this is not a betting project, but it's a SCIENTIFIC AMPLIFICATION project.

### Preface and problem description
Have you ever encountered a friends, that tells you some conspirological theories? 
* like, "dangerousness" of some new kind of tech (can be any kind)
* or a friend who's trying to prove that world is controlled by one government (one one reptiloid?)

If the answer is yes, you'd probably struggle to bring him to common grounds: science.
People tend to believe in crazy things. The more crazy thing is, the more people might believe it.
Information technologies gives us power to spread information, no matter how serious, true or fake it is.

So we need to deal with this problem. I found one way to do it.

### Project full description
Web-based tool where two or more sides of meet in the common grounds of real science and proofchecked information.
System involves the "competing" sides, and jundges-voters.

### Project pipeline with examples
= DRAFT STATE =
1) One or two sides of the conflict rise their topic. For example, "alcohol protects you from viruses".
2) Each side of the conflict takes one of the position: "pro-position" (says that topic is TRUE) and "opposing force position" (says that topic is FALSE)
3) Criterias are setted-up, for example: "10 fact-checked science articles from popular science source"
4) Criterias are described: here you describe what means "fact-checked", describe sources lists of "popular science sources"
5) Time-frame is set: 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 5 years etc. Can be any date in the future.
6) Judges are invited (can be one ESCROW jundge or multiple ones; but ideally an odd number of judges)
7) Prize pool rules is set:
* what currencies to use for this problem (can be ideally a cryptocurrency, but normal currencies might also be accepted)
* condition if one side wins (for example, gets 90% of the prize minus 5% judge comissions and 5% platform comissions)
* condition if both sides are somewhat correct (for example, each side got their full money back)
"Problematic" conditions can either be setted by creators OR by platform:
* condition on judges not found (ex., money back)
* condition on technical problems (full money back)
* condition on problem timeout (judges didn't decided but the end date reached): (ex.: money back minus 5% to platform)
8) The money from ONE or BOTH sides is frozen in platform ESCROW
After at least one side frozes it's money in ESCROW, we're entering hte PRE-ACTIVE STATE.
= PRE-ACTIVE STATE =
If money is received from one ESCROW side, the problem is published online and available for review, but the judges are not arranged.
At the moment the money was received by BOTH sides and frozen in ESCROW smart contract, we're entering ACTIVE STATE.
= ACTIVE STATE =
If money gathered in ESCROW from both sides, we know that both of the deal's sides take problem seriously.
Process of arranging the judges starts and it can take some time, depending on the number of judges, but the problem is anyway published online.

### Everyone is involved!
Other users, that are not part of the deal and not the judges, can make a DONATION for a WINNING CONDITION.
They CANNOT vote for any side, rather they are DONATING towards the SCIENTIFIC CONDITION that will win.
Remember - this is not a betting website idea, rather than SCIENTIFIC IMPLIFICATOR idea.
When donating, they can choose what to do with their money in case the deal is unsolved/cancelled/mediated 50/50%.
For example, they can spread money 50/50 to winners or ask the platform to send their money back.

Platform should get larger comission (example: 2x...10x to normal comission) for fiat currencies because they involves gateways and chargebacks.

FINALE: After the 

### Platform roles
a) users that adds the "deals" or "problems"
b) judges that decide on the problems (can be one or multiple, but ideally odd number)
c) administrators and tech stuff that handles problems with the system

### ONE DEAL = ONE ROLE
* All users are able to fullfill all roles (except admin roles obviously), but inside ONE DEAL each user is assigned ONLY ONE ROLE.

### Reputation and trasparency
* Platform should show reputation for USERS and JUDGES as well as money earned in the process
* All platform code should be opensource, published & ideally verified by trusted users or companies
* All updates to the platform should be done only after user voting on the idea, except for the fixing technical faults


## Functions list
* Copyright: The platform for this should be NOCOPYRIGHT audio-video-stream solution similar to dlive.tv (otherwise it will be blocked)

## Comment structure example
```
RR, please play "Artist - Songname" song.
```
This comment can be parsed for "RR, please play" and then we take everything in quotes. After, we separate the Artist from trackname by searching for dash "-" and after this, we can use the data to search in some good sources for WAV, OGG, FLAC, MP3 or whatever we can find.

## Platform development options
As just a draft idea, we can spin a Linux server (on a desktop, laptop or actual server) with the following software:
* Comment parser: written in PHP or Javascript that updates comments on a regular basis in search for artist & track names

Optionally, radio could have also have a "normal" radio stream option (without a video stream)

## Sources for the tracks
What comes to my mind (please update this file if you know better or additional ones):
* Youtube-dl to download videos and convert them to audios (`youtube-dl "ytsearch1:metallica - nothing else"`) - this option will give HUGE database of tracks but of medium to medium-low quality OR we can even use source youtube videos
* Telegram bots that search for music and return files (this will usually provide better files than youtube, but the database will be smaller)
* Open track databases, something similar to jamendo (this DB is even smaller, but can provide highest quality files as well as these tracks can be legally played and broadcasted)

Please feel free to add your track source if you know some (as this project will probably start as a hobby project and there won't be any huge money invested in the start, please provide free-as-in-freedom or free-as-in-beer sources).

Mentioning author of the project idea - @sxiii would be really nice.
