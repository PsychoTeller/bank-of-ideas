## Decentralized Worldwide Ads Service (or Goods Exchange)

## Project brief description
Decentralized service that will allow anonymous goods or services exchange both locally and internationally.
Without full control over your personal information.

## Project full description
There are many regional and local advertisement websites where you can sell old stuff (and sometimes also services).
But nowadays governments are trying to take the control over them with force.
Russian service Avito had been forced into service that will link directory to people's information.
So now, when you buy or sell any good or service in Russia, you will have to pay tax, and you have no choice.

In the real life opportunity to pay or not to pay taxes should be decided by person itself.
Whenever he sees need in paying taxes from his sold piano or old computer, it's up to him.
Also, personal data of the people should be PERSONAL, not governmental. Without agreement, web services 
SHOULD NOT share personal data with anybody, including governments, police, FBI, FBR, NSA, CIA, 14 eyes, whatsoever.

## Tech specs
* Should be decentralized, so zero single points of failure (P2P or E2E)
* May use or may not use blockchain. This is not much of importance.

## Any real examples?
* Yes, but only for cryptocurrencies (we need for goods & services): https://bisq.network
