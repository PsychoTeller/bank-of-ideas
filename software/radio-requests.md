# RadioRequests project

## Brief description
Automated radio audio-video stream that fetches and plays songs that followers are requesting.

## Project full description
The idea behind this is pretty simple. As we used to call by phone to radio to request a song for a playback 
(or - send SMS or text message by other means in more recent times), it would be very interactive and cool to
allow listeners of the radio drop a comment of special kind and that would call a parser, that will try to
search for a song, download it, and schedule for playback.

## Functions list
* Copyright: The platform for this should be NOCOPYRIGHT audio-video-stream solution similar to dlive.tv (otherwise it will be blocked)
* Search: RadioRequests should allow searching in several large databases for track files, then fetch & download them.
* Source Rankings: Ideally, sources should have "points" and users (who are requesting the track) should been able to vote for the track quality after track has started playing
* Limits: RadioRequests should have a some sort of DB (textfile will be OK) with user nicknames that already ordered the tracks to prevent them from ordering again in the nearest TIMEOUT (30, 60 minutes etc.)
* Donator's bonuses: Ideally, you could order more tracks after you donate (in some way) to the channel
* Follower's bonuses: You could have +1 more track order per day if you're follower
* Track-ban list: Radio might need a blacklist that will block several tracks for requests due to quality, unsuitable style or moral policy

The idea for this project appeared after I found a lot of people are requesting tracks on Music channels in DLive.tv service.
