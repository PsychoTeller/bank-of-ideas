## The Open Bank of Ideas
Have you ever felt that you have really cool idea, but lacked something to develop it further?
It might be lack of knowledge, resources, human, time, money or a mix of these points?
But you still believe that idea is so cool and need to be made someday buy someone?
THE OPEN BANK OF IDEAS IS YOUR SAFE TICKET! Read on next to know more.

The following document is a FAQ about The Open Bank of Ideas.

### What is this all about
The Open Bank of Ideas is DRAFT place to openly exchange ideas for any project.
It can be anything, from small electronic device that will help people do something, to multi-purpose international corporation. DRAFT, because github is mostly good for this task, but NEVER PERFECT. I might decide to move the bank somewhere. Ideally, we would prefer to move to some sort of blockchain-based, decentralized git, if we this solution will be more stable than github (but github and gitlab would still receive mirrors of The Open Bank in this case)

You can see this as a global, international brainstorming room, where everybody is always welcome!
In the same way, The Open Bank can be seen as human ideas preservation place, similar to "Svalbard Global Seed Vault"  (github projects are stored there too, so OUR IDEAS might be in the next batch!).
In another way, you can see The Open Bank as an open information space. You can sent your idea to float and develop in here.

Q: "Can I work on my own project here, (and use this to hunt a team or more ideas)"?
A: YES, this is also welcome in The Open Bank of Ideas.

If you're still thinking "is my idea worth adding to the bank?", go to the FAQ section called "Adding ideas to the bank (AKA RULES)" and add your idea with special marker. Add your concirns about why it SHOULD and why it SHOULD NOT be made by somebody, and as the next step community will discuss your ideas and it's future here. Everybody's ideas are welcome!

NB: In more complex projects, people might decide to actually USE the idea but go a DIFFERENT ROUTE comparing to idea / plan / description. In fact, this will happen most of the time. This is normal, nobody's to blame, it's called **pivoting** in startup/business environment or **forking** in github terminology.

### What is the purpose of the bank?
* Let the ideas come true (better if your idea will be made by some community, rather then never made by anyone, right?)
* Solve the "lack-of-creativity" or "stucking" problem (it's when you're tired in the process of finding an interesting idea) * Give an fascinating, motivating and entertaining out-of the box experience
* Honor the author of the idea in case if he wants to (NB: similar ideas might **already** be introduced by other people long time before The Open Bank of Ideas appeared!)

Important to note here: **NO STRINGS ATTACHED**. It means, that your idea can be stored and not realized. Or your idea might be realized without mentioning you as an author. Or the ideas published here might not lead to successful projects or won't allow you earn some skills or money. It might help you find a team or build your community as well as it might destroy your team or community. So, by using The Open Bank of Ideas you realized that no strings attached.

### Who can use the bank?
* startuper (solo) or a startup team
* scientist
* creative professions: coder, DIY person, artist, painter, book writer, musician or DJ, photographer, videographer
* other individual (you?)
* individual, company (both for-profit and non-profit)

### What ideas can be in the bank?
A good item for the bank would be:
* A startup idea with basic project description (example: a VR/AR/MR gaming park of a new level)
* Business plan of certain level (ideally, including the most parts) (example: how to make a new type of restaurant)
* Idea of a new methodology that will help with something (example: methodology on how to build an opensource city)
* Description of new methodic of study (example: how to study chemistry to understand it better and faster)
* New mixed research area that isn't developed enough (example: biology of the brain + IT = neuro-interfaces etc.)
* Computer game idea (example: a quest game about small creatures that are secretly live beneath the planet surface)
* New computer gaming experience idea (ex.: new physical controller type, game with new principle etc.) 
* Film idea (it can be anything from indie film to a large hollywood-style blockbuster)
* Electronic device idea or project drawing to create some sort of useful device
* Software idea, software methodology, code examples etc (main github stuff that's already in here)
* Economics or fin-tech idea (example: new cryptocurrency or token project)
* Transparency, governance or management idea (examples: new decentralized or blockchain project)
* Interconnection or networking ideas (examples: new network protocol or topology)
* Cypher or encryption idea (example: new quantum-tolerant encryption algorithm)
* New standard, standard group or standardizing methodology (example: standarts for creating optical links for quantum computers)
* If you're still unsure, go to the FAQ section called "Adding ideas to the bank (AKA RULES)" and add your idea with special marker. Add your concirns about why it SHOULD and why it SHOULD NOT be made by somebody, and as the next step community will discuss your ideas and it's future here. Everybody's ideas are welcome!

### What else can be in the bank?
Any smaller idea for the **creating** an object (physical or virtual) will also do: 
* book (may include or not include main plot points)
* audio track (may include or not genre and track texture)
* painting (may include or not include pallette and style)
* social/blog post, topic, or social campaign based on some topic

### What should be level of the detail to get into the bank?
The level of detail of the project can be any (but the more developed the better):
* Basic draft of the idea without large description
* Medium-described projects with some ideas and details around it
* Fully-blown project with business plan, financial plan, drawings, schematics and simulations

The level of detail of your publication will also clarify your own level of interest in the development and might attract (or distract) other developers. Please take your time to prepare high-quality materials, without grammatical or other errors at your best.

### What can be physically included in the bank? "How my idea will be represented here?"
Basically, it's three things:
1. Mentioning of your idea/project in according section of The Open Bank of Ideas with link to point #2.
2. Markdown file in this repo's according folder. The markdown file itself should include the brief idea, while also ideally include reasoning, author's words, project status, involved persons list, contact details, and what's most important - links  to the project's main repo (yes, you'd ideally make your own repo for the project and cross-link it here!) and to the project website, if it exists.
3. Brief images and illustrations of your project, that might be required for better understanding of point #2.

If you're ready to add your project, move to "How to add your idea" section.

We don't want to make The Bank of Ideas a scrapyard of tonns of information. So each and every project is suggested having **one, brief text markdown description file** and maybe **few images** included. All additional information (that well-developed idea or project definitely should have!) needs to be placed in your own repos/websites and cross-linked from markdown.

### Adding ideas to the bank (AKA "RULES")
1. Agreement on success: you should be ready that your idea can be taken AND made by somebody (in any way or type). This is the main project goal, although it won't be reached too often, because even good ideas are hard to make at the start (in the "lack-of-everything" state).
2. Agreement on (un)mentioning of the autor: you should be okay BOTH to be NOT included as author of resulting project and TO BE included as author of resulting project. The actual person or community may decide him or herself, and, what's more important, the idea might just even appear as outside of The Open Bank of Ideas. This happens all the time and it's TOTALLY NORMAL! Lastly, by using The Open Bank of Ideas, you should realize, that even if you ask for NOT MENTIONING you as an author, you **STILL CAN BE** mentioned if decided so by the actual developer of the idea or project. So, to sum up: you can **politely ask** the community to include or not to include you, but it **might not work out as you asked** in the result. We do, however, recommend each and every project developer to honor the author and follow his guidelines/requests if possible.
3. Agreement of being polite person. Upon publication of your idea, you realize that somebody might find it good or stupid, good-for-profit (even if it's idea of opensource software) or good as opensource project (even if your project is described as a closed-source software). So you agree of not being rude, not blame anyone for changing the direction of your idea or project, for doing something wrong (or correct). Moral and etiquette is your best friends in here, as we gather for development and improvement, not for hatespeech discussion and ruining ideas.
4. Transparency agreement. The idea of "The Open Bank of Ideas" is sharing, exchanging, improving and caring. Please do understand that transparency is a requirement in here and if you want somebody to make or improve your project, you need to share 200% of your ideas, materials etc. etc. For example, you might want to include a link to your own github repository with more details on your project.
5. Moral & Etique. Your idea should be GOOD in general terms of Moral and Etique. We will NOT elaborate on what is Moral and Etique here explicitly and ON PURPOSE. Please go read on this topic in any other preferred source and develop your morality yourself! As an easy to understand example, we will have a zero tolerance on projects related to creating a weapons of any kind, crimes against humanity, hidden surveillance projects, projects that will highly probably lead to runied world, destroyed climate, bad ecology, or animal-harm projects. If you're unsure about your project, please share it with tags #unsure and #moderation-required, and we will try to find resources to research on the topic and find it as "general good" or "general bad". Please do understand that if your idea will fall into "general bad" category, it might be banned from The Open Bank of Ideas, sorry for that. 

### How to add your idea (AKA "THE PROCESS")
1. Clone this repository
2. Add your idea to the section (folder) that you think it should belong, as a markdown file, with the following name scheme: [ folder/project-name-superbrief-proposal.md ]. For example, if you would like to add a description about your idea of making a neuro-helmet as a neuro-interface for doctors, please make file similar to [ neuro/neurointerface-for-doctors.md ]. Add images if needed as files [ neuro/neurointerface-for-doctors-illustration-1.png ].
3. Create a pull request with short info on your project.

### What should be in the project's markdown file?
1. Brief / super short description about your project. Ideally, in 3 phrases.
2. "Medium" / normal idea description, without too much details. Usually this is from half page of text up to 2 pages of text.
3. Images (one, two or several) can be included here too as markdown allows. The format is ```! [ img name ] ( img url )``` without spaces.
4. External links. The format is ```[ link name ] ( link url )``` without spaces: 
* idea / project repository link 
* idea / project website link
* github issue discussion link
* any additional link that's relevant
5. Author of the idea and preference or non-preference of mentioning of the author.
6. Proposed license scheme for the project.

### What is markdown and how it's done?
It's an easy and understandable syntax for writing a documents, briefs and other papers. [Read more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

### Licensing schemes for The Open Bank
The idea behind the Open Bank of Ideas movement is basically an open-source movement. So we have a "opensource code of honor" and we do appreciate the idea MORE, the MORE it is open. But as the Open Bank of Ideas cannot limit any kinds of licenses, here we do have all three "levels" of licensing:
1. PREFERRED LICENSE: Any copyleft, open-source and viral license. Examples: GPL, CC Share-alike. "Viral" means that **to legally develop a forked opensource project you MUST have THE SAME LICENSE (hense viral) and link the upstream source code or idea**.
2. OKAY LICENSE: Any open-source, permissive, weak copyleft, public domain or less/un-viral license. This may be useful for semi-open-semi-proprietary projects that would have to include some proprietary parts. Examples: MIT, BSD, WTFPL, Apache, Mozilla, CC aka "Some Rights Reserved", etc. Basically, any "open-source"-typed license will do.
3. POSSIBLE, BUT NOT RECOMMENDED: Any other license, proprietary or whatever. 

Please bear in mind that licensing scheme for the idea or project **will be followed-up** by the Open Bank of Ideas community **only** if you already have your own repository with clearly stated license in there. If you don't have the project yet or it's only in the state of planning, any person in the world can take your idea, make the project and license it according to his or her willing.

### Discussions, issues and further work
* Discussion around projects & ideas (general discussions!) are welcome here in "Github Issues".
* One issue / discussion per project.
* Project markdown file should include the link to general discussion, and general discussion should link to the project markdown descripton (cross-linking).
* If you want to discuss project or idea "in details" or start working on it, please find author's attached repository for the project and discuss in-detail there. If project repo does not exist, create it **AND THEN LINK** this new repo in two places: first, the project markdown ".md" documentation file (read "THE PROCESS" section), second, in the project discussion in issues (if it exist).

### Case for projects that already exist
First rule of thumb for authours: **please check that your project does not exist in the way you want/see it before publishing**. Very often, the authors of the project or idea don't know that somebody already implemented it in a good or better way. Please do your own research on existence of your idea **at least in two different languages** and **at least in two search engines**. The more you research, the better.

Although, nothing bad will happen even if you publish the project and later community find 10 or 100 implementations of it. Your project will be marked as "already implemented", and will be saved under this category (for the future reference) unless you provide evidence of serious differences or reasons why your project should be published separetely. 

Also, if you're unsure about similarity to other projects, please do publish it with tags #unsure and #moderation-required, the Open Bank of Ideas community will jump and help you with further research.

### Recommended tags
* Need some resources to help your idea or project? Add tags that fits: #help-wanted #need-coder #need-marketing #need-designer #need-hr #need-manager #need-cofounder #need-investor #need-scientist #need-research #need-office #need-tester #need-community #need-seo #need-hosting #need-website #need-repo #need-translation etc.
* if you're unsure about level of your project: #unsure and #moderation-required
* still working on project's description draft? Add: #draft (remove #draft after you finish with description and basics)
* other tags might be added in the future

Cross collaboration is our power. Let's go develop!
