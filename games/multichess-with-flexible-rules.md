## Multichess

## Project brief description
A PHP or similar Web-based chess game with lobby, chat and extremely flexible boards and rules.

## Project full description
This is a concept for multiplayer chess game with extremely flexible rules sets.

Chess is really interesting and fascinating game with old rules and terms. But it might be
updated to match more diverse world.

Here's the list what can be done:
* Main game hall room where all the players can chat and follow into private rooms ("city hall")
* Free rooms, mixed rooms and "money rooms" where players play for actual money (crypto)
* Open (publically visible) games and closed (private) games
* For the open games, everybody can run into a "bet-fight" betting on one player while the other side bets on another
* Replays for the open and private games

## Game options
* Normal chess 1x1 with classic ruleset
* Editable chess board (!) important - different forms for different amount of players
* Editable starting chess figures (numbers and positions)
* Some ready made board sets and figures sets

## Game modes
Most of the game modes needs to be ported from a normal PC deathmatch games like Quake
* FFA or "Normal Deathmatch": mode for 3 or more players, the rules can be edited
* Team deathmatch mode ("2x2", "3x3", "4x4", "5x5" etc)
* CTF: capture the enemy's flag and carry it to your base
* Capturing a neutral base: get to some point on the board (or map) and stay there for some turns
* Distraction: don't allow enemy to reach certain point on the map
* Quest or logic mode: follow specific task

## Game bonuses
Can be controlled in the room settings as all other settings are.
Bonuses can be all activated instantly, all put into inventory, randomly activated on pulled into inventory or be setted up by rules (which bonus goes when) 
Good bonuses: additional chess piece/figure, teleport (on your choice), additional/second turn, capturing enemy figure (becomes yours), additional turn for another piece/figure, another random bonus, double bonus, moving enemy chess piece/figure somewhere, additional chess piece for allies, capturing the enemy figure (for some time), "minus time", "plus time for enemies"
Bad bonuses: loosing your figure, random teleport, loosing your inventory of bonuses, switching your figure to enemy, additional time, less time for enemies
Neutral or unknown: random teleport for both you and enemy (-ies)

## Limits that can be set
* Limiting each player turn time
* Limiting the team time
* Limiting the whole game time

## Board options
Chess boards created to handle games 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, castle-style, labyrinth-style.
Boards can include "walls" that cannot be stepped on. Walls might be destroyed by bonuses, events or special actions.
Boards can have a "fall down" places where, if figure stands, it's lost in the void (dies instantly)
Figures can have optionally health bar included; in this game mode each chess piece have health and "hit" strength
Traps can be placed by another player's; they can be visible and invisble

## Monetization
* Game can have a subscription-based model and "pay once" mode for "premium" options
