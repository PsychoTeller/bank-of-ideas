## Telegram client that DOES the job

## Project brief description
Telegram is great personal messanger. But it's official version was never suitable for any professional work.
We need features of professional chats like Matrix (Riot), IRC, Mattermost or Slack for personal effectiveness and comfort.

## Project full description
Good thing is that my idea is not something imaginary. We already have a good external clients out there developed:
* Plus (telegram messenger for android phones): allow separating everything
* Bettergram (telegram desktop messenger): allow separating of favourites, public, private chats and channels

## What does need to be separated?
All of the following objects are DIFFERENT already in Telegram API. We need to bring this difference into the user interface (UI).
* Private chats ("Users")
* Groups
* Supergroups
* Channels
* Bots
* Favorites
* Administration / privileged channels (where we are admins or moderators)
* Unread
* "Telegram" behavior tab (all together, useless but still)

Without separating this stuff Telegram is useless for anything than chatting with 20 of your friends.

Pavel Durov recently added MANUAL folders functionality. No, Pasha, We DO NOT NEED MANUAL FOLDERS.
WE NEED AUTOMATED FOLDERS & CATEGORIES. I don't understand how Pavel Durov and his team doesn't see that.

Manual folders are useful additional feature, but the main idea I am speaking about here is very important.

## Why not use Plus and Bettergram?
* Bettergram has stopped developing somewhere in 2018, but still works mostly perfect for me (I use it now)
* For Plus, I am also using it, but I would prefer similar features from good community opensource project
